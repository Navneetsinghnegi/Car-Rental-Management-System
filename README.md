# Car-Rental-Management-System

The Car Rental Management System is a Java-based project developed using NetBeans and MySQL. It aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing car rental operations. The system caters to three types of users: customers, salespersons, and administrators, each with specific roles and functionalities.

Customers have access to their own data and can perform tasks such as creating invoice orders and booking vehicles. They can view available cars, check their rental history, and make reservations based on their needs.

Salespersons play a crucial role in managing customer interactions. They have the ability to view all customer data and can create rental orders on their behalf. Additionally, they are responsible for generating delivery notes when vehicles are rented out. Salespersons can also add or remove cars from the inventory based on availability.

Administrators have comprehensive access to all system data. They can manage staff, customers, and cars efficiently. Administrators can add, remove, or increase the quantity of cars in the system. They have access to detailed sales reports, enabling them to monitor performance and analyze profitability for the entire month.

The system utilizes a MySQL database to store and retrieve information securely. The graphical user interface (GUI) developed using NetBeans offers a user-friendly experience for all types of users.

With its robust functionality and role-based access control, the Car Rental Management System provides an efficient solution for managing car rental operations. It offers a seamless experience for customers, streamlines salesperson tasks, and empowers administrators with comprehensive control and reporting capabilities.
